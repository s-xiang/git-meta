Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current
HEAD commit, paths that have differences between the working tree and the
index file, and paths in the working tree that are not tracked. The first are
what you would commit by running git commit; the second and third are what you
could commit by running git add before running git commit.  Output is grouped
sub-repo.  Also show diagnostic information if the repository is in consistent
state, e.g., when a sub-repo is on a different branch than the meta-repo.`;
